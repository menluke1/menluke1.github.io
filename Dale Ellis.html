   <h1> Dale Ellis</h1>
    Career: 1983-2000

    Team(s): Dallas Mavericks, Seattle Supersonics, Milwaukee Bucks, San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets, Charlotte Hornets

    Three-point career stats: 1,719-4,266, (.403)

The greatest thing that ever happened to Dale Ellis' career was getting dealt from Dallas to Seattle. He went from averaging 15.1 MPG to 37.5 and with that increase in PT the threes started raining like uh...*is lazy* Seattle's climate. Northwest is not only a ridulous name Kanye and Kim gave their kid, it's also where Dale Ellis set about amassing the league's three-point record.

He became the league's most improved player in 1987 and shot 48 percent from downtown in '88-89. After injuries sent his numbers into a decline he toured in Milwaukee, San Antonio and Denver before being sent back to the Emerald City in 1997. There, at age 37, he led the NBA in three-point percentage by connecting to a tune of .464. For two more seasons he built upon his record and retired with 1,719. Since then it's been shat on by nine different guys (and counting) but we still felt it necessary to pay homage to a man who perfected the 'catch and shoot.'
