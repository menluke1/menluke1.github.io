There's something to be said for guys who connect on more than 40 percent of their three-point attempts. As you can attest to, those men are well represented on this list. But, there's also something to be said for a guy who shoots near that while being the top scoring threat for his team. In California's capitol city, Mitch Richmond was that guy.

While scoring over 20,000 points in his career, Mitch took almost 1,000 threes between 1995 and '97, hitting over 43 percent. The creators of NBA Jam took notice, making him the most dominant perpetually "on fire," player in the game. Plus his form was so beautiful that nobody will blame you for busting out the paper towels and Jergens while watching "Mitch Richmond's shot," on YouTube.
